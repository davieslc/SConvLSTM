# SConvLSTM 

This is a quick implementation of SConvLSTM from `[Novel Deep Learning Network for Gait Recognition Using
Multimodal Inertial Sensors](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/2/849)' for only the [UCI-HAR](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) dataset.

Preprocessing of the raw dataset was copied from [UCI-Human-Activity-Recognition](https://github.com/arijitiiest/UCI-Human-Activity-Recognition?tab=readme-ov-file).
